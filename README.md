# Maze-Solver

A GUI that uses Search Algorithms such as Depth-First Search to solve a maze using Java, JavaFX and OOP


### How do I compile/run my code

For convenience some execution scripts have been included that will compile/run code with the `--add-modules` flag set (for Java FX). Use `javac.sh` to compile on Linux and Mac OS, or `javac.bat` to compile on Windows. Likewise, use `java.sh` to run on Linux and Mac OS, or `java.bat` to run on Windows. E.g.

```
$ cd maze-solver
$ ./javac.sh src/MazeApplication.java  
$ ./java.sh MazeApplication
```

### How do I compile/run the tests?

A shell file has been included, `run_tests.sh`, that should work on Linux/Mac OS.

```
$ ./run_tests.sh
```

The file `run_tests.bat` should do the same thing on Windows.
